## Summary: 
- It looks like I'm getting a job out of Hattiesburg so I'm looking for someone to take over my lease.

- This apartment is ideal for two tenants since the split layout has this huge living space in between the two bedrooms, each with their own full bath.

- Security Deposit: The security deposit is already paid for($200).

- Lease will be directly with the apartment office (not a sublet) 

- There is an application fee for the office but if approved, I will gladly refund your application fee.
