So I just finished initializing this site using Jekyll and bootstrap. It's minimal, but it gets the job done.  <p><br> Jekyll is a markup language that I just learned this weekend and I'm growing to like it. It has code markup syntax and loads of other features that are not found in simple static html - [Jekyll] makes code reuse much easier </p>
<br>
For the next iteration of updates, I plan to add in some video and audio - more multimedia projects , and put in what I'm working on. Anyways, if you appreciate minimalism as much as I do, feel free to fork this from [github]
